# _Belly-Button_Biodiversity_

### Purpose of the analysis 

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that interacts with a belly button biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js. The dashboard includes a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
